There are 4 key components of any program:

| Keyword or Phrase | Explanation | In Cooking | In Python | In HTML/JS |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Program/Code | The written instructions that explain what operations to perform | Recipe | Program/Code | Program/Code |
| Input | Everything the program doesn't supply on its own that's still needed | Ingredients | Input | Input |
| Output | The result of using/running the program | The finished dish | Output | Output |
| Interpreter | The thing that knows how to read the program and do what it says | Chef | The 'python' command in the terminal application | Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc) |

However, there's a lot more ways to stretch this analogy - let's see how far we can go!

| Keyword or Phrase | Explanation | In Cooking | In Python | In HTML/JS |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Language | The language the program is written in | English | Python | HTML/JS |
| Fixing a bug | Making a minor change since the output wasn't quite what you wanted | Adding seasoning, making a small alteration | Fixing a bug | Fixing a bug |
| Adding a feature | Making a major change that completely changes the finished product | Replacing the core of the dish, altering it so much it's an entirely new dish, etc | Adding a feature | Adding a feature |
| Running 'live' code | Running the program perpetually, taking inputs as they come and producing more outputs upon request | Restaurant | Webserver | Website/App |
| IDE | The workspace for developing your program, with premade tools to expedite the process. As there can be many ways to design a kitchen, there are many possible IDEs. | Kitchen | PyCharm | JSFiddle |
| Refactoring | Changing the instructions in the program without changing the intended output at all | Combining two steps of the recipe | Refactoring | Refactoring |
| Repository | Where you store your programs for you and others to find and reuse them | Cookbook | Github.com | Github.com |
| Networking | How someone can interact with your 'live' code | Opening your restaurant to the public and publicizing the address | Connecting your server to the internet and giving it an IP | Packaging your app and giving it to Apple to distribute |

We can even talk about the pieces of the code using this analogy!

| Keyword or Phrase | Explanation | In Cooking | In Python | In HTML/JS |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Functions | Reusable parts of your program worth giving special names to, but which you have to learn the meaning of once before you can use. Frequently act slightly differently depending on the input you want them to process. | "Julienne", "Marinate" | def add_one_to_this_number(input_number): return input_number + 1 | addOneToThisNumber(inputNumber) {return inputNumber + 1;} | 
| Instructions | Key words that the Interpreter needs to understand | Mix, stir, spoon, etc | if, def, while, etc | let, this, null, etc |
| Variables | Special names to refer to something you've already started processing | "Grab *the sauce from step 2* and..." | new_variable = 'hi ' + 'mom'  | let newVariable = 2 * 3 / 6; |
