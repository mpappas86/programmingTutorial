There are 4 key components of any program:

| Keyword or Phrase | Explanation | In Cooking | In Python | In HTML/JS |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Program/Code | The written instructions that explain what operations to perform | Recipe | Program/Code | Program/Code |
| Input | Everything the program doesn't supply on its own that's still needed | Ingredients | Input | Input |
| Output | The result of using/running the program | The finished dish | Output | Output |
| Interpreter | The thing that knows how to read the program and do what it says | Chef | The 'python' command in the terminal application | Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc) |

However, there's a lot more ways to stretch this analogy - let's see how far we can go!

| Language | The language the program is written in | English | Python | HTML/JS |
| Fixing a bug | Making a minor change since the output wasn't quite what you wanted | Adding seasoning, making a small alteration | Fixing a bug | Fixing a bug |
| Adding a feature | Making a major change that completely changes the finished product | Replacing the core of the dish, altering it so much it's an entirely new dish, etc | Adding a feature | Adding a feature |
| Running 'live' code | Running the program perpetually, taking inputs as they come and producing more outputs upon request | Restaurant | App/Webserver | Website |
| IDE | The workspace for developing your program, with premade tools to expedite the process. As there can be many ways to design a kitchen, there are many possible IDEs. | Kitchen | PyCharm | JSFiddle |
