<!--Again, this is similar to the previous page. There are 2 big things to notice, though.-->
<!--The first is that we have "onload='display()'" when we define the body. That means-->
<!--that as soon as you try to load the webpage, the website will immediately call the-->
<!--"display()" function, defined towards the top here in javascript. That function checks-->
<!--the "clicked" variable - which is set for us by the python code - and if it is true,-->
<!--automatically sets the "demo" text to be the date, without waiting for the user to press the button again.-->
<!--The second thing that happens is that when the user presses the button, it now triggers the SetDateTime()-->
<!--function. This changes the "demo" text to the date, but also calls the "api/clicked" endpoint,-->
<!--which will tell our database that the user has clicked on the button!-->
<!--So in summary, we alert our database when the user clicks, and then the database tells us they've clicked if we ever forget.-->
