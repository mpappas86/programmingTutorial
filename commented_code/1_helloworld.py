# Since this line starts with a '#' character, it's a comment!
# That means it is text saved to this file like any other, but the
# interpreter - which will decide what this text is telling it to actually do -
# will ignore these comments entirely. These are just here so humans can
# understand what's going on!

# The keyword "print" is special in python - it means "output the thing I'm about to say".
# So in human terms, this python function is just saying
# "The output of this function is 'Hello World!'"
print "Hello World!"
