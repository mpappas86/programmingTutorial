<!--This is how you add a comment in HTML! It's one of many ways Python is more readable. -->
<!--HTML is primarily a formatting language - it's less about manipulating data and more about laying out different parts of the webpage.-->
<!doctype html>
    <head>
        <!--For instance, here we're setting the title of the webpage!-->
        <title>Our Webpage!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!--And here we're adding the body - what shows up on the main page. It's some text - Hello World! - and a button.-->
        <p>Hello world! </p>
        <!--The button logic is a bit tricky to read but roughly means "If someone clicks me, set the thing labeled as "demo" to the current date!"-->
        <!--Notice the "demo" label on the block right below the button - which currently says DatetimeWillDisplayHere.-->
        <!--So "DatetimeWillDisplayHere" will be replaced by the date when you press the button.-->
        <button type="button"
    onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
    Click me to display Date and Time.</button>
        <p id="demo">DatetimeWillDisplayHere</p>
    </body>
</html>
